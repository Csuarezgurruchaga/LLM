# Sentiment Analysis with GPT-3.5-turbo API

## Overview

This project leverages the GPT-3.5-turbo API to perform sentiment analysis tasks. It showcases both few-shot and zero-shot classification for sentiment analysis. Additionally, the project integrates text vectorization using the `text-embedding-ada-002` embedding model. This model generates embeddings, which serve as input features for a Random Forest classifier, for sentiment analysis.
